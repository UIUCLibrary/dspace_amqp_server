# DspaceAmqpServer

This is a messaging system based on Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), which is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. It works by setting up an AMQP client that receives JSON objects from providers. Then it downloads and unzips the file and save it as a bag so that it can be passed to the packager.  


## Usage

Commands:
"start" to run
"stop" to stop the process
